I wish that I could make a case for the benefits of agile dev methodology, but ever since entering the industry, I have felt nothing except consistently hindering bureaucracy and overhead from the way most teams implement agile practices.

## The Intention Behind Agile

I recently just finished reading over [The Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/). Agile, as a process, is broken into twelve principles. These are:

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive
   advantage.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10. Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

In my experience, each one of these principles has been violated in some way, shape, or form by the teams I've worked with by no fault of any single individual. The irony is that these violations often lead to slower development cycles, more bugs, and lower overall quality.
The intention of agile is to treat software development as an optimization problem for human intention.
This is evident in the fact that each of these principles is based on (fighting against) natural human tendencies.

## Agile Stems from Human Nature

Look at each of the rules above. They are all based on the idea that humans are fallible, easily distracted, and prone to miscommunication.

1. Humans tend to get caught up in perfecting their product rather than delivering value quickly.
2. Sunk Cost Fallacy! Humans resist change, especially when they have already invested time and effort into a particular direction.
3. Humans have a tendency to procrastinate and delay delivering value.
4. Humans are social creatures and work best when they can communicate directly. Isolation ultimately leads to miscommunication.
5. Humans are inheritly lazy. If we can cut corners, we will.
6.
