I recently have been working in a lot of Java, and have become exhausted by the rediculous amount of required syntax for parallelism. 
I vaguely recalled learning about go's concurrent and parralel functional patterns, and have decided to come back and truly learn those patterns. 
By the end of this journey, I hope to go from the absolute basics to building out a containerized ecosystem of interdependent golang services. `No AI btw`.
