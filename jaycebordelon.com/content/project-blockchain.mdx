Working in fintech, I frequently get asked about cryptocurrency especially pertaining to [stablecoins](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/insights/market-insights/market-updates/on-the-minds-of-investors/what-is-a-stablecoin/) and blockchain technology. 
While I have a decent high-level understanding of these concepts, I realized that my theoretical knowledge of the underlying functionality was lacking.
It is one thing to understand the theory behind blockchain, but another monster to understand how it is implemented in code. 
To address this gap, I decided to embark on a learning journey by building a simple blockchain from scratch using Golang.


## Why Golang?

Still Building...
